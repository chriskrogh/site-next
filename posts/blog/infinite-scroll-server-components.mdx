title: Infinite Scroll Server Components with Next.js and react-query
description: Learn how to implement infinite scroll using server components and server actions in Next.js and react query. Optimize performance by fetching and rendering data on demand without page reloads, ensuring a seamless user experience. Perfect for long lists or feeds in React applications.

### Context

<br />

<u>[Server components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components)</u> are
a great tool that allow us to render our UI closer to our data and send less JS
and JSON down to browsers.

<br />

The programming model for rendering from the server -> the client is quite seamless, but if our UI is meant to be rendered
on the **server only** then sometimes we need to reach back out from the client to the server to render more content
_without_ reloading the page.

<br />

This typically happens when the experience that we're building resembles a long list or a feed of some sort since we may not want to fetch & render
everything upfront. For the sake of example, let's say that this was the UI that we want:

<br />

<img
  src="/blog/infinite-scroll-server-components/demo.gif"
  className="w-full"
/>

<br />

We have a list of heavy UI components that can only be rendered on the server, each of
which has a client component child that can be used to refetch / invalidate the
list. As the user scrolls, we want to render more of these components.

<br />

### Solution

<br />

The first idea that might come to mind when implementing something like this is to use a search param to keep track of the
page number / cursor. However, each time the search param changes, Next.js loads the server component payload for the entire page
(which becomes really large as the user scrolls). Not only that, but the user's scroll position is lost each time which jumps them back to the top.

<br />

Instead, we can use âœ¨<u>[server&nbsp;actions](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-actions)</u>âœ¨ (another React feature that Next.js implements) to
fetch & render server components on demand.

<br />

First off, we can fetch the first page of data, render it to some _Item_ s on the server, and pass the rendered components down to a client _List_ component.

<br />

```tsx
// page.tsx

export default async function Home() {
  // Fetch the initial data
  const data = await fetchData({ pageNumber: 0 });

  // Render the initial items
  const initialItems = data.map((i) => <ListItem key={i} item={i} />);

  // Pass the initial items down to the client
  return (
    <main className="flex flex-col p-8 items-center">
      <List initialData={{ payload: initialItems, pageNumber: 0 }} />
    </main>
  );
}
```

<br />

_List_ mounts an infinite query that caches **rendered components**. We can seed the query cache with the initial items that were rendered on the server.
When the user scrolls past a certain point, we can use a server action to reach back out to the server to fetch and render more items.

```tsx
// List.tsx

"use client";

export const List: React.FC<Props> = ({ initialData }) => {
  // Cache the rendered RSC payloads using react-query.
  const { data, fetchNextPage } = useInfiniteQuery({
    queryKey: ["list"],
    queryFn: ({ pageParam }) => fetchItemsAction(pageParam),
    initialPageParam: INITIAL_PAGE_NUMBER,
    initialData: {
      pages: [initialData],
      pageParams: [INITIAL_PAGE_NUMBER],
    },
    getNextPageParam: (lastPage) => {
      if (!lastPage) return undefined;
      return lastPage.pageNumber + 1;
    },
  });

  // When the last element comes into view, we fetch the next page
  const { ref, inView } = useInView();
  useEffect(() => {
    if (inView) {
      fetchNextPage();
    }
  }, [fetchNextPage, inView]);

  // Flatten the pages into a single array of items
  const items = useMemo(() => {
    return flatMap(data?.pages, (page) => page.payload);
  }, [data?.pages]);

  return (
    <>
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <Fragment key={index}>
          {item} {/* <- ReactNodes rendered on the server! */}
          {index === items.length - 3 && (
            <div ref={ref} className="invisible" />
          )}
        </Fragment>
      ))}
    </>
  );
};
```

<br />

The server action does exactly what you'd expect. It fetches the next page of data, renders the items, and returns them to the client.

```tsx
"use server";

export const fetchItemsAction = async (pageNumber: number) => {
  const data = await fetchData({ pageNumber });
  const items = data.map((i) => <ListItem key={i} item={i} />);
  return { payload: items, pageNumber };
};
```

<br />

Invalidating the list is also really easy. We can use <u>[queryClient.invalidateQueries](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/query-invalidation)</u> to refetch pages of UI components.
This will call the server actions sequentially (starting with the first page) to fetch the data and render the items.

```tsx
"use client";

export const InvalidateButton: React.FC = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  const invalidateList = () =>
    queryClient.invalidateQueries({
      queryKey: ["list"],
    });

  return (
    <button
      className="p-1 m-0 border-2 border-blue-500 bg-none"
      onClick={invalidateList}
    >
      invalidate
    </button>
  );
};
```

<br />

And that's it! We've implemented infinite scroll server components with Next.js and react-query.
The user can scroll through the list and fetch more items without reloading the page.
