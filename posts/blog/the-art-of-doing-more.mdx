Navigating Feature Work and Growth

<br />

## Background

<br />

For a long time, I‚Äôve been asked these questions by other engineers: ‚ÄúHow do you balance xyz with feature work?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow do you do all this stuff?‚Äù and also ‚ÄúAre you on the platform team now?‚Äù

<br />I haven‚Äôt had good answers to any of these questions (other than ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm
not on the platform team‚Äù). I probably get asked these a lot because I ship a
reasonable amount of PRs that are unrelated to the product surfaces that my team
owns.
<br />
This is going to briefly touch on why that is, but more importantly how I manage
to do this while not falling behind on my team‚Äôs roadmap.

<br />

## Why?

<br />
### Growth
<br />

To keep growing my React technical skills, our codebase & infrastructure needed to be migrated to unlock React‚Äôs next generations (hooks, server components, compiler, etc). Migrations are full of technical challenges which are great growth opportunities.

<br />
Also, slow builds make it hard for everyone to get things done, so speeding them
up is important. Our infrastructure and platform are broad and have a deep
roadmap, so waiting for the core team to prioritize everything is a losing
battle. Optimizing CI is also full of interesting technical problems that you
probably wouldn‚Äôt encounter in your day-to-day work.
<br />

</Card>

Unlocking ‚Äúnew‚Äù React features helped us improve the speed of our website, and optimizing CI increased our developer velocity - both of which are important to Faire.

<br />

These are just two examples, but there are many other avenues for impact that exist. ‚ÄúFinding opportunities‚Äù is up next on my list of things to write about, but the TLDR is: fix the things that pain you the most. If you‚Äôre unsure how to align your goals with your company's, it might be helpful to seek a mentor!

<br />

## How?

<br />
### For small swings
<br />
Estimate less of your effort towards the roadmap.
<br />
Here‚Äôs how I think about this:
<br />

When I first started, I spent nearly 100% of my time on roadmap work. After getting comfortable with our tech stack and build processes, I was eventually on par with the average engineer.

<br />

As I gained more experience with shipping features, I got more comfortable and started moving a bit faster.

<br />
This is where I think a lot of great engineers land today, and it‚Äôs a good place
to drive a ton of impact. Once I got here, I decided to spend slightly less time
on the roadmap and a little more time on non-roadmap work.
<br />

I try never to fall below the average amount of roadmap output, but some weeks will require more time spent on the roadmap than others & vice versa. So here‚Äôs how I think I spend my time:

<br />

<br />
My bias is always toward the roadmap. If I don‚Äôt have any non-roadmap work
planned, I move the roadmap along faster. But most times I have non-roadmap work
available to fall back on whenever there‚Äôs a gap.

<br />

#### Important notes

<br />

<ul>
  <li className="mb-2 pl-4">
    The extent to which you can invest time external to your team‚Äôs roadmap is
    determined by the time you're able to carve out of a working week - either
    by being more efficient, putting in extra time, or reassigning /
    reprioritizing your responsibilities.
  </li>
  <li className="mb-2 pl-4">
    A big part of this is managing expectations. If your manager knows you are
    trying to grow in a certain area and you are doing impactful work, then the
    team can make space and adjust timelines. If your manager has no idea what
    you‚Äôre working on then they can‚Äôt help advocate.
  </li>
</ul>

<br />

### For big swings

<br />
> Get your ideas onto the roadmap.
<br />
If you have an idea for something big that you‚Äôd like to work on, your best bet
for getting staffing for the project is to bring it onto our roadmap.
<br />

A huge component of this is clearly defining the scope and plan to tackle the big swings. Teams can‚Äôt commit to work that they don‚Äôt know the scope of (i.e. is it 2 weeks or is it 2 months?). A key tactic here is to break bigger projects into incrementally deliverable milestones ‚Äî this makes big projects much more palatable and also more shareable.
