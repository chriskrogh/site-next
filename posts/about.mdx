## my story

<br />I grew up in Trinidad 🇹🇹 and always loved building things (LEGO,
Minecraft). When I was 14, I asked my dad "What job would pay the best by the
time I finish school?" He said "Probably Software Engineering" and that was good
enough for me - even though I didn't know anything about it at the time.

<br />I ended up doing well in my last 2 years of high school and was awarded an
open scholarship by the Ministry of Education to study anywhere in the world. I
decided to do CS at the [University of Waterloo](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca) 🇨🇦
because of their [co-op program](https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education).

<br />I learnt [React](https://react.dev) ⚛️ in my first semester to land an
internship for the summer and it kind of ruined my university for me. Not
because it was bad, but because I fell in love with building things that people
could use instead of solving contrived, theoretical problems.

<br />
Anyways, I stuck it out to the end and got my shiny piece of paper:
<br />

<Card className="flex gap-4 p-6 items-center mb-4">
  <img
    src="/uw_logo.png"
    alt="University of Waterloo"
    width={50}
    height={54}
    className="w-[50px] h-[54px]"
  />
  <div>
    <h5>University of Waterloo</h5>
    <p>Bachelor of Computer Science (Statistics Minor)</p>
    <p>2017-2022</p>
  </div>
</Card>

but I enjoyed my 5 internships much more than the courses 😄

I moved to Toronto after graduating and started working at [Faire](https://faire.com) full-time 🚀.
I'm learning all the time and enjoy working with some of the smartest people I've ever met.
